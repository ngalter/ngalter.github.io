I have several years of industry experience both as an employee and as a freelance developer. I strive to continually update my knowledge and improve my skill set.</p>
                    <p>I have programmed and I maintain several websites for not-for-profit and for-profit organizations.  My top priorities are security, functionality and optimization. My websites have a variety of features ranging from GDPR compliance, paid membership, event management and SEO.</p>
                    <p>My goal is to offer a wide set of services to my clients.  The broad range of knowledge that this class teaches will allow me to offer better service and more options to my clients.</p>
                    <p>I have several outside interests in addition to my work as a website developer.  I run a small property management company.  I am an avid tennis player, and I love animals.</p>
